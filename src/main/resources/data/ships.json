  "description" : "\"All things can be understood once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.\"\nThis was the motto of the USS Discovery when it was launched into service. Officially designated a Crossfield class science vessel, the Discovery's facilities could accommodate 300 discrete scientific investigations at any one time.\nHowever, Discovery's mission statement would change drastically after the Battle at the Binary Stars in 2256. \nWith Starfleet stretched thin and the Klingons advancing toward Federation space, Discovery was pressed into service as a warship, one that would turn the tide of the conflict. The key to Discovery's military success was its unique spore drive, which allowed it to travel galactic distances in the blink of an eye.\nThis incredible technology made Discovery invaluable to Starfleet's war efforts and its captain was given virtually limitless resources and jurisdiction to fight the war as he saw fit. The USS Discovery, once a science vessel built for research and experimentation, had become the tip of the spear in a war for the fate of the Federation.",

The Franklin was pressed back into service and upgraded by a mysterious Independent Commander to take the fight to the Swarm.

  "description" : "As skirmishes on the border of the Klingon Neutral Zone became more and more common, the Romulan Empire’s fleets found themselves increasingly at the mercy of Klingon war parties. At long range, a well-crewed Augur was more than capable of holding its own against the Klingon hordes, but in the short-range dogfights preferred by the Imperial Fleet, the Romulans found themselves at a disadvantage. Klingon D4s were too fast and nimble, easily flanking the slower Romulan battleships and hitting them at their weakest points.\nThis was unacceptable. To combat this threat, the Romulan Senate instructed esteemed physicist and engineer Tuvan Zin to design a new vessel that could outperform the D4 in short-range combat.\nTuvan was given three weeks. It was enough.\nUtilizing the rare Sigma Tritanium, Tuvan developed a vessel capable of maneuvering at near-light speed. The Velox’ triple reinforced Sigma Tritanium hull plating is immensely flexible, with thermal protections capable of withstanding up to 6,000 degrees Kelvin. This allows it to take the kind of high-risk, high-mobility engagements that Romulan forces had never truly excelled in.\nIts weaponry was also expressly designed with Klingon vessels in mind. The Velox is armed with a bank of twenty-three disruptor banks and twelve photon-torpedo tubes, more than enough to overpower similarly nimble vessels.\nThe Velox is the perfect microcosm of the Romulan spirit; we will stand dominant no matter the cost or challenge.",

  "description" : "Some ships are more than the sum of their parts. Some ships carry with them a legacy, a lineage that extends to the stars and beyond. Throughout the history of humanity’s journey through the stars, there have been a handful of vessels to receive such legendary status.\nOf all of these, the Enterprise-E was possibly the greatest.\nThe pinnacle of Starfleet design, the Sovereign Class Enterprise-E was drafted into service shortly before the Dominion War and was to serve, just like its predecessors, as the flagship of the Federation’s fleet. Many of its iconic crew would return to serve aboard the Enterprise-E again. Worf, The only exception, chose to return to Kronos and serve as the Federation’s ambassador.\nStarfleet had spared no cost in upgrading its flagship from its already impressive previous iteration. The Enterprise-E came equipped with four additional phaser arrays and five additional photon torpedo tubes.\nThis daunting firepower would prove vital in the coming trials as the Enterprise-E carried its crew into their most challenging adventures yet. Aboard this mighty vessel, Picard and his crew faced down the Borg Queen, stopped the machinations of a nefarious Starfleet Admiral, and defeated the powerful and vengeful Shinzon.",

  "description" : "Named for a particularly deadly reptilian race on the Klingon homeworld, the Krencha more than lives up to its namesake’s reputation.\nDesigned at the height of the Dominion War, the Krencha was to be the Klingon Empire’s response to Jem’Hadar warships. The Empire’s D4s and Bortas class vessels made up the bulk of their fleet, but they lacked the necessary combination of firepower and maneuverability that the Jem’Hadar forces boasted. The Empire needed a counter.\nThe Krencha was designed with this in mind. Fast, nimble, and deadly in equal measure, it utilizes cutting-edge Sigma Dilithium-powered impulse engines, triple-reinforced Sigma Tritanium hull plating, and a massive array of forty-three disruptor banks and fifteen photon torpedo tubes. This makes the Krencha the fastest, most maneuverable, and deadly vessel in the Klingon Fleet. All of this power does come with a cost, however. Like its homeworld namesake, the Krencha is built for quick hit-and-run engagements. Its weaponry, though impressive, draws an obscene amount of power.\nStill, even with this drawback, the Krencha has rightfully taken its place as the Klingon Empire’s spearhead.\nSo, enemies of the Empire, be warned. If you see a crimson glow in the stars and hear the telltale chime of the Krencha’s impulse engines... It is already too late.",

  "description" : "Built in secret to be the ultimate weapon in a madman’s plot for revenge, the Scimitar was designed to be a machine of war and Reman vengeance, beyond anything the galaxy had seen before.\nThis monster of a vessel was designed with one goal: to destroy the Romulan Senate and end the tenuous peace between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. This was no easy task, but the Scimitar was more than up to the challenge.\nUsing the latest in Romulan cloaking technology, the Scimitar’s cloaking functionality was, to quote Geordi LaForge, “perfect”. It emitted no tachyons and left no residual anti-protons. The Scimitar was a ghost, a specter of destruction led by Shinzon in a bid to avenge the Remans upon the Romulan Senate.\nHowever, the Scimitar did not need to rely solely upon its stealth capabilities. It was more than capable of dealing death to even the mightiest of vessels with its impressive weapons array of fifty-two disruptor banks and twenty-seven photon torpedo tubes, roughly five times the armament of any other single ship.\nUnder the control of a keen mind, the Scimitar can be more than a warship.\nIt can be death incarnate.",

The Ex-Borg used their ingenuity and their knowledge of Borg technology to bring that Cube back to life and to allow it to be replicated, albeit with a few key changes: this Borg Cube cannot assimilate its targets, and its power systems are centralized, allowing it to be manned by a conventional crew rather than a compliment of a hundred thousand drones.\n\nThe Ex-Borgs' work on the Borg Cube now allows Independents the galaxy over to experience the power of the Borg.

She is the long-awaited child of technology and ambition, made possible thanks to the tireless research of Dr. Henry Archer and Dr. Zefram Cochrane, who spent decades perfecting the warp drive, making distant stars reachable in weeks and even days. The pinnacle of human civilization of its time, <i>NX-01</i> was tasked with an almost impossible mission: explore the galaxy and prove that people have a well-deserved place in it.  \n\nStarfleet’s mission of finding strange new worlds proved perilous from the start. Since its maiden voyage, <i>NX-01</i> repeatedly found itself in the midst of the most intense conflicts, dicey adventures, insidious plans, and unprecedented dangers, be it a perspective of full-scale Klingon Civil War, or the deadly Temporal Cold War. But no matter which challenges <i>NX-01</i> faced, it had Captain Archer and his crew at the helm. Their ingenuity and bravery built the <i>Enterprise</i> legacy that now spans centuries and precedes not only the ship itself but also Starfleet and the United Federation of Planets.",

It comes equipped with a frankly ridiculous array of weapons, including red and blue particle cannons, four resonance cannon batteries, a full complement of gannet magnets, pulse catapults, and quantum rockets. This makes the Protector one of the deadliest vessels in the known galaxy.\nHowever, none of its weapons compare to the mysterious Omega-13 Device. Capable of transporting the Protector back in time by thirteen seconds, this immensely powerful artifact allowed its crew to defeat the tyrant Sarris.",
